  tautology ->
    1 is 1
    1 isnt 2
    1 is 1 and 1 isnt 2
    1 is 2 or 1 isnt 2
    on is true
    yes is true
    off is false
    no is false
  confusing ->
    unless not off then print 'how did i get here?'
  useful ->
    @name = name
  example ->
    launch() if ignition is on
    volume = 10 if band isnt SpinalTap
    letTheWildRumpusBegin() unless answer is no
    if car.speed < limit then accelerate()
    winner = yes if pick in [47, 92, 13]
    print inspect "My name is #{@name}"
